                <div className="space-y-3">
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.1.</strong> We are BRIGHT EVOLVE LTD, a limited company incorporated in England & Wales
                    with company number 14701094, whose registered office is at 23 Westfield Park, Bristol, England, BS6
                    6LT ('we, 'our' and 'us).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.2.</strong> You are the person using our website, services, or the Ascent platform
                    ('platform'), including any of the outputs of the services ('deliverables') (collectively, the
                    'services') ('you', 'your' and 'yours').
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.3. Agreement.</strong> These terms and conditions ('these terms' or 'terms of service')
                    form an agreement ('agreement') between you and us (the parties) for the provision of the services
                    to you. By using the services, you accept these terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.4. Platform.</strong> We provide the following services on a non-exclusive basis: (a)
                    access to the platform on different subscription tiers ('plan'): (i) Tier 1 (Self-serve): £695 (plus
                    VAT) for 12 months' access (minimum term) to the Ascent platform. (ii) Tier 2: (Supported): £2,995
                    (plus VAT) for 12 months' access (minimum term) to the Ascent platform, and tailored support from an
                    expert consultant. (b) consultancy services and charges agreed from time to time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.6. Subscriptions.</strong> Each subscription is valid for one legal entity in one country
                    and one authorised user per entity, unless otherwise agreed. If your organisation comprises or spans
                    multiple legal entities or countries, each entity in each country needs to purchase a separate
                    subscription to have access to the platform. The subscription grants access to the individual or
                    individuals expressly authorised by you ('authorised users'). You agree to ensure that each
                    authorised user complies with these terms and conditions, and they will also need to accept these
                    terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.7. Ordering services.</strong> You can place an offer to purchase services via us or our
                    website by following the onscreen prompts and instructions provided. Each order is an offer by you
                    to purchase services subject to these terms. Our acceptance of your order takes place when we
                    provide access to the platform or send you an acceptance email.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.8. Agreeing consultancy services.</strong> The parties can agree services in principle
                    from time to time in statements of work or, where agreed, via email. If we agree to provide those
                    services, both parties shall execute the statements of work or, where applicable, mutually agree
                    them via email. Statements of work form part of, and are incorporated into, the agreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.9. Updates to these terms.</strong> We may amend these terms from time to time and updates
                    are effective immediately upon written notice to you by email. If any update materially adversely
                    affects your rights and obligations, those changes will be effective no sooner than 30 days after we
                    notify you. Your continued use of the services means you agree to such changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.10. Security.</strong> You agree to use all reasonable endeavours to prevent unauthorised
                    access to or use of the platform, including safeguarding login credentials, and you accept
                    responsibility for all activities on your account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.11.</strong> 'Agreed' means agreed in writing by the parties, and 'writing'/'written'
                    includes email, in these terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>1.12. Priority.</strong> Provisions in this clause 1 shall have priority over provisions in
                    the rest of these terms to the extent of any conflict or ambiguity.
